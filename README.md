# Logicwatch

Course: EPFL - EE110 - Logic systems (autumn semester 2017/2018)

Project: a digital multifunction watch implemented using only logic gates

## Physical constraints

- Two push buttons A and B
- Six seven-segment displays (SSDs)
- Ten LEDs
- One power-on-reset button
- One clock (2KHz crystal oscillator)

The project is meant to run on a Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA board.

## Features

The watch has five distinct operation modes (time, stopwatch, alarm, time setting, countdown). The user can switch between the modes by pressing A and B simultaneously for a longer period of time in a circular manner (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> etc). The first five LEDs (n째0-4) indicate which mode is currently active.

### Mode 1 - Time

Time is kept with the format {month - day of the week - date - hours - minutes - seconds}. Pressing on A allows to change from the display of {month - day of the week - date} to {hours - minutes - seconds} and vice-versa. Pressing on B changes the time format from european to american and vice-versa. When using the american time format, LEDs n째6-7 indicate wether time is AM (n째6) or PM (n째7).

### Mode 2 - Alarm

The first four SSDs from the left indicate {hour - minute} at which the alarm should sound. The sixth SSD (far right) is either one (alarm ON) or zero (alarm OFF). At any time and on any mode, the tenth LED (far right) indicates whether the alarm is On or OFF. 

The SSD of the field being modified blinks. Pressing button A increments the field being modified. Pressing B changes the field being modified (from left to right).

When the alarm "sounds", a special LED animation is triggered. To stop it, any button can be pressed.

### Mode 3 - Stopwatch

Stopwatch indicates {minutes - seconds - centiseconds}. Pressing on B resume/pause the chronometer. Pressing on A while the chronometer is paused will reset it at zero. Pressing A while the chronometer is working will do nothing.

### Mode 4 - Time setting

Similarly to alarm setting, the SSD of the field being modified blinks. Pressing A increments the field being modified. Pressing B changes the field being modified (from left to right). After going through every field with B (month -> day -> date -> hour -> minute -> second) none of the SSDs blink. At this point pressing A will validate the changes, while pressing B will bring the user back to modifying the month and then all the other fields.

### Mode 5 - Countdown

### Power-on-reset (PoR)

Pressing the PoR button will reset every mode with its default values. It is important as it allow to put the system in a known state and thus guarantee a correct behavior.

## Notable technical solutions

- Various finite state machines
- Switch debouncing system
- Simultaneous button press detector
- PoR initialization
- (...)

## How to use it

Launch `logisim-evolution-2.13.19.jar` and from there open `MAIN.circ`. Then you can start the simulation. Depending on your computer performance and the settings of the simulation, time will most likely not be accurate. It can however be calibrated by modifying certain logic circuits.
