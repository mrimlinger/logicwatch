# Logicwatch

Course: EPFL - EE110 - Logic systems (autumn semester 2017/2018)

Project: a digital multifunction watch implemented using only logic gates

## Physical constraints

Two push buttons A and B
Six seven-segment displays
One power-on-reset button
One clock

## Features

The watch has five distinct operation modes (time, )

## Notable technical solutions

- Various finite state machines
- Switch debouncing system
- Simultaneous button press detector

## How to use it

Launch `logisim-evolution-2.13.19` and from there open `MAIN.circ`. Then you can start the simulation.
